The project revolves around a text document classification dataset comprising 2225 news articles categorized into five distinct classes: politics, sport, tech, entertainment, and business. With the aim of enhancing document organization and retrieval, this dataset presents an opportunity for document classification and clustering tasks. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques, the project seeks to develop models capable of accurately categorizing and grouping news articles based on their content. This endeavor not only facilitates efficient information retrieval but also holds potential for uncovering insights into the underlying patterns and themes prevalent in the dataset.
